_Happy Plants_ is a web application which wants to help you keeping your plants happy!

_This is a personal project of mine to help me keeping track of all the plants I have and still in active development. There is currently no desktop version, only mobile. Desktop is planned, but for now focus is on mobile._

## Features
This project is currently still very early in development and only has a bare minimum set of features. So far, you can:

- Add a new plant, add a name and photo
- Have an overview of all your plants
  - Filter them by date and name
- View your plants
  - Add notes
  - Update the growth seasons
- Download your data from the settings page
